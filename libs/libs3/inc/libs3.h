 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * This library provides an API for using Amazon's S3 service (see
 * https://s3.amazonaws.com/).  Its design goals are:
 *
 * - To provide a simple and straightforward API for accessing all of S3's
 *   functionality
 * - To not require the developer using libs3 to need to know anything about:
 *     - HTTP
 *     - XML
 *     - SSL
 *
 *   In other words, this API is meant to stand on its own, without requiring
 *   any implicit knowledge of how S3 services are accessed using HTTP
 *   protocols.
 *
 * - To be usable from multithreaded code
 * - To be usable by code which wants to process multiple S3 requests
 *   simultaneously from a single thread
 * - To be usable in the simple, straightforward way using sequentialized
 *   blocking requests
 *
 * The general usage pattern of libs3 is:
 *
 * - Initialize libs3 once per program by calling S3_initialize() at program
 *   start up time
 * - Make any number of requests to S3 for getting, putting, or listing
 *   S3 buckets or objects, or modifying the ACLs associated with buckets
 *   or objects, using one of three general approaches:
 *   1. Simple blocking requests, one at a time
 *   2. Multiple threads each making simple blocking requests
 *   3. From a single thread, managing multiple S3 requests simultaneously
 *      using file descriptors and a select()/poll() loop
 * - Shut down libs3 at program exit time by calling S3_deinitialize()
 *
 * All functions which send requests to S3 return their results via a set of
 * callback functions which must be supplied to libs3 at the time that the
 * request is initiated.  libs3 will call these functions back in the thread
 * calling the libs3 function if blocking requests are made (i.e., if the
 * S3RequestContext for the function invocation is passed in as NULL).
 * If an S3RequestContext is used to drive multiple S3 requests
 * simultaneously, then the callbacks will be made from the thread which
 * calls S3_runall_request_context() or S3_runonce_request_context(), or
 * possibly from the thread which calls S3_destroy_request_context(), if
 * S3 requests are in progress at the time that this function is called.
 *
 * NOTE: Response headers from Amazon S3 are limited to 4K (2K of metas is all
 * that Amazon supports, and libs3 allows Amazon an additional 2K of headers).
 *
 * NOTE: Because HTTP and the S3 REST protocol are highly under-specified,
 * libs3 must make some assumptions about the maximum length of certain HTTP
 * elements (such as headers) that it will accept.  While efforts have been
 * made to enforce maximums which are beyond that expected to be needed by any
 * user of S3, it is always possible that these maximums may be too low in
 * some rare circumstances.  Bug reports should this unlikely situation occur
 * would be most appreciated.
 *
 * Threading Rules
 * ---------------
 *
 * 1. All arguments passed to any function must not be modified directly until
 *    the function returns.
 * 2. All S3RequestContext and S3Request arguments passed to all functions may
 *    not be passed to any other libs3 function by any other thread until the
 *    function returns.
 * 3. All functions may be called simultaneously by multiple threads as long
 *    as (1) and (2) are observed, EXCEPT for S3_initialize(), which must be
 *    called from one thread at a time only.
 * 4. All callbacks will be made in the thread of the caller of the function
 *    which invoked them, so the caller of all libs3 functions should not hold
 *    locks that it would try to re-acquire in a callback, as this may
 *    deadlock.

/**
 * This operation lists in-progress multipart uploads. An in-progress
 * multipart upload is a multipart upload that has been initiated,
 * using the Initiate Multipart Upload request, but has not yet been
 * completed or aborted.
 *
 * @param bucketContext gives the bucket and associated parameters for this
 *        request; this is the bucket for which service access logging is
 *        being set
 * @param prefix if present and non-empty, lists in-progress uploads only for
 *        those keys that begin with the specified prefix.
 * @param keymarker if present and non-empty, together with upload-id-marker,
 *        this parameter specifies the multipart upload after which listing
 *        should begin.
 * @param uploadidmarker if present and non-empty, together with key-marker,
 *        specifies the multipart upload after which listing should begin.
 * @param encodingtype if present and non-empty, requests Amazon S3 to encode
 *        the response and specifies the encoding method to use.
 * @param delimiter if present and non-empty, is the character you use to
 *        group keys.
 * @param maxuploads sets the maximum number of multipart uploads,
 *        from 1 to 1,000, to return in the response body.
 * @param requestContext if non-NULL, gives the S3RequestContext to add this
 *        request to, and does not perform the request immediately.  If NULL,
 *        performs the request immediately and synchronously.
 * @param timeoutMs if not 0 contains total request timeout in milliseconds
 * @param handler gives the callbacks to call as the request is processed and
 *        completed
 * @param callbackData will be passed in as the callbackData parameter to
 *        all callbacks for this request
