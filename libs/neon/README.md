# neon

_neon_ is an HTTP and WebDAV client library, with a C language API.

GitHub: https://github.com/notroj/neon | Web: https://notroj.github.io/neon/

The neon API and ABI are stable and maintain backwards compatibility
since 0.27 through to 1.0.0. From neon 1.0.0 onwards, semantic
versioning will be used. https://semver.org/

Features:

 - High-level interface to HTTP and WebDAV methods.
 - Low-level interface to HTTP request handling, to allow implementing
   new methods easily.
 - Persistent connection support (HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 aware)
 - Basic and Digest authentication (RFC 7616/7617, including SHA-2, userhash)
 - Kerberos (Negotiate) and SSPI/NTLM authentication (Unix and Windows)
 - HTTP and SOCKS (v4/5) proxy support (including authentication)
 - SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL or GnuTLS (client certs via files or PKCS#11)
 - Generic WebDAV 207 XML response handling mechanism
 - XML parsing using expat or libxml2
 - Easy generation of error messages from 207 error responses
 - Basic HTTP/1.1 methods: GET, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS, conditional PUT
 - WebDAV resource manipulation: MOVE, COPY, DELETE, MKCOL.
 - WebDAV metadata support: set and remove properties (PROPPATCH), query
   any set of properties (PROPFIND).
 - WebDAV locking and ACL (RFC 3744) support
 - Autoconf macros supplied for easily embedding neon directly inside 
   an application source tree.

Provides lower-level interfaces to directly implement new HTTP
methods, and higher-level interfaces so that you don't have to worry
about the lower-level stuff.
