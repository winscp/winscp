  DESCRIPTION_2000_LETTERS, "WinSCP is a popular free SFTP and FTP client for Windows. Moreover, WinSCP is a powerful multi-functional tool that will improve your productivity. WinSCP can copy files between a local and remote computer using multiple protocols: FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, WebDAV or S3. On the one hand, WinSCP offers an easy to use graphical user interface; you can choose between Windows Explorer look and tabbed twin-panel interface like Norton commander. On the other hand, advanced users can automate WinSCP functionality using .NET assembly or simple batch file scripting. You will use WinSCP for all common operations with files. You can start editing a file directly from WinSCP, either using WinSCP internal text editor or using integration with your favorite external text editor. WinSCP operations are not limited to individual files; WinSCP offers several ways to synchronize your remote and local directories. After connecting to a site you can choose to store site information for repeated access, WinSCP can even share site settings with another popular open source tool PuTTY. WinSCP integrates also with Pageant (PuTTY authentication agent) for full support of public key authentication with SSH. Admins love WinSCP support for portable operation using a configuration file instead of registry entries, suitable for operation from removable media. A comprehensive WinSCP documentation is freely accessible at https://winscp.net/. This site hosts also a very active user forum for support and feature requests. WinSCP is available in English and many other languages. WinSCP is an open source software distributed free of charge under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)."
