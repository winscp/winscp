\S{plink-manpage-description} DESCRIPTION

\cw{plink} is a network connection tool supporting several protocols.

\S{plink-manpage-options} OPTIONS

The command-line options supported by \cw{plink} are:

\dt \cw{-V}

\dd Show version information and exit.

\dt \cw{-pgpfp}

\dd Display the fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys and exit,
to aid in verifying new files released by the PuTTY team.

\dt \cw{-v}

\dd Show verbose messages.

\dt \cw{-load} \e{session}

\dd Load settings from saved session.

\dt \cw{-ssh}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol (default).

\dt \cw{-telnet}

\dd Force use of Telnet protocol.

\dt \cw{-rlogin}

\dd Force use of rlogin protocol.

\dt \cw{-raw}

\dd Force raw mode.

\dt \cw{-serial}

\dd Force serial mode.

\dt \cw{\-proxycmd} \e{command}

\dd Instead of making a TCP connection, use \e{command} as a proxy;
network traffic will be redirected to the standard input and output
of \e{command}. \e{command} must be a single word, so is likely to
need quoting by the shell.

\lcont{
The special strings \cw{%host} and \cw{%port} in \e{command} will be
replaced by the hostname and port number you want to connect to; to get
a literal \c{%} sign, enter \c{%%}.

Backslash escapes are also supported, such as sequences like \c{\\n}
being replaced by a literal newline; to get a literal backslash,
enter \c{\\\\}. (Further escaping may be required by the shell.)

(See the main PuTTY manual for full details of the supported \cw{%}-
and backslash-delimited tokens, although most of them are probably not
very useful in this context.)
}

\dt \cw{-P} \e{port}

\dd Connect to port \e{port}.

\dt \cw{-l} \e{user}

\dd Set remote username to \e{user}.

\dt \cw{-m} \e{path}

\dd Read remote command(s) from local file \e{path}.

\dt \cw{-batch}

\dd Disable interactive prompts.

\dt \cw{-pw} \e{password}

\dd Set remote password to \e{password}. \e{CAUTION:} this will likely
make the password visible to other users of the local machine (via
commands such as \q{\c{w}}).

\dt \cw{\-L} \cw{[}\e{srcaddr}\cw{:]}\e{srcport}\cw{:}\e{desthost}\cw{:}\e{destport}

\dd Set up a local port forwarding: listen on \e{srcport} (or
\e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and forward any connections
over the SSH connection to the destination address
\e{desthost}:\e{destport}. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{\-R} \cw{[}\e{srcaddr}\cw{:]}\e{srcport}\cw{:}\e{desthost}\cw{:}\e{destport}

\dd Set up a remote port forwarding: ask the SSH server to listen on
\e{srcport} (or \e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and to
forward any connections back over the SSH connection where the
client will pass them on to the destination address
\e{desthost}:\e{destport}. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{\-D} [\e{srcaddr}:]\e{srcport}

\dd Set up dynamic port forwarding. The client listens on
\e{srcport} (or \e{srcaddr}:\e{srcport} if specified), and
implements a SOCKS server. So you can point SOCKS-aware applications
at this port and they will automatically use the SSH connection to
tunnel all their connections. Only works in SSH.

\dt \cw{-X}

\dd Enable X11 forwarding.

\dt \cw{-x}

\dd Disable X11 forwarding (default).

\dt \cw{-A}

\dd Enable agent forwarding.

\dt \cw{-a}

\dd Disable agent forwarding (default).

\dt \cw{-t}

\dd Enable pty allocation (default if a command is NOT specified).

\dt \cw{-T}

\dd Disable pty allocation (default if a command is specified).

\dt \cw{-1}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 1.

\dt \cw{-2}

\dd Force use of SSH protocol version 2.

\dt \cw{-4}, \cw{-6}

\dd Force use of IPv4 or IPv6 for network connections.

\dt \cw{-C}

\dd Enable SSH compression.

\dt \cw{-i} \e{keyfile}

\dd Private key file for user authentication. For SSH-2 keys, this key
file must be in PuTTY's PPK format, not OpenSSH's format or anyone
else's.

\lcont{ If you are using an authentication agent, you can also specify
a \e{public} key here (in RFC 4716 or OpenSSH format), to identify
which of the agent's keys to use. }

\dt \cw{\-noagent}

\dd Don't try to use an authentication agent for local authentication.
(This doesn't affect agent forwarding.)

\dt \cw{\-agent}

\dd Allow use of an authentication agent. (This option is only necessary
to override a setting in a saved session.)

\dt \cw{\-hostkey} \e{key}

\dd Specify an acceptable host public key. This option may be specified
multiple times; each key can be either a fingerprint (\cw{99:aa:bb:...}) or
a base64-encoded blob in OpenSSH's one-line format.

\lcont{ Specifying this option overrides automated host key
management; \e{only} the key(s) specified on the command-line will be
accepted (unless a saved session also overrides host keys, in which
case those will be added to), and the host key cache will not be
written. }

\dt \cw{-s}

\dd Remote command is SSH subsystem (SSH-2 only).

\dt \cw{-N}

\dd Don't start a remote command or shell at all (SSH-2 only).

\dt \cw{\-nc} \e{host}:\e{port}

\dd Make a remote network connection from the server instead of
starting a shell or command.

\dt \cw{\-sercfg} \e{configuration-string}

\dd Specify the configuration parameters for the serial port, in
\cw{-serial} mode. \e{configuration-string} should be a
comma-separated list of configuration parameters as follows:

\lcont{

\b Any single digit from 5 to 9 sets the number of data bits.

\b \cq{1}, \cq{1.5} or \cq{2} sets the number of stop bits.

\b Any other numeric string is interpreted as a baud rate.

\b A single lower-case letter specifies the parity: \cq{n} for none,
\cq{o} for odd, \cq{e} for even, \cq{m} for mark and \cq{s} for space.

\b A single upper-case letter specifies the flow control: \cq{N} for
none, \cq{X} for XON/XOFF, \cq{R} for RTS/CTS and \cq{D} for
DSR/DTR.

}

\dt \cw{\-sshlog} \e{logfile}

\dt \cw{\-sshrawlog} \e{logfile}

\dd For SSH connections, these options make \cw{plink} log protocol
details to a file. (Some of these may be sensitive, although by default
an effort is made to suppress obvious passwords.)

\lcont{
\cw{\-sshlog} logs decoded SSH packets and other events (those that
\cw{\-v} would print). \cw{\-sshrawlog} additionally logs the raw
encrypted packet data.
}

\dt \cw{\-shareexists}

\dd Instead of making a new connection, test for the presence of an
existing connection that can be shared. The desired session can be
specified in any of the usual ways.

\lcont{
Returns immediately with a zero exit status if a suitable \q{upstream}
exists, nonzero otherwise.
