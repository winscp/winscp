# -*- makefile -*-
# 
# This file describes which PuTTY programs are made up from which
# object and resource files. It is processed into the various
# Makefiles by means of a Perl script. Makefile changes should
# really be made by editing this file and/or the Perl script, not
# by editing the actual Makefiles.

# Help text added to the top of each Makefile, with /D converted
# into -D as appropriate for the particular Makefile.

!begin help
#
# Extra options you can set:
#
#  - FWHACK=/DFWHACK
#      Enables a hack that tunnels through some firewall proxies.
#
#  - VER=/DSNAPSHOT=1999-01-25
#      Generates executables whose About box report them as being a
#      development snapshot.
#
#  - VER=/DRELEASE=0.43
#      Generates executables whose About box report them as being a
#      release version.
#
#  - COMPAT=/DAUTO_WINSOCK
#      Causes PuTTY to assume that <windows.h> includes its own WinSock
#      header file, so that it won't try to include <winsock.h>.
#
#  - COMPAT=/DWINSOCK_TWO
#      Causes the PuTTY utilities to include <winsock2.h> instead of
#      <winsock.h>, except Plink which _needs_ WinSock 2 so it already
#      does this.
#
#  - COMPAT=/DNO_SECURITY
#      Disables Pageant's use of <aclapi.h>, which is not available
#      with some development environments (such as older versions of
#      the Cygwin/mingw GNU toolchain). This means that Pageant
#      won't care about the local user ID of processes accessing it; a
#      version of Pageant built with this option will therefore refuse
#      to run under NT-series OSes on security grounds (although it
#      will run fine on Win95-series OSes where there is no access
#      control anyway).
#
#  - COMPAT=/DNO_MULTIMON
#      Disables PuTTY's use of <multimon.h>, which is not available
#      with some development environments. This means that PuTTY's
#      full-screen mode (configurable to work on Alt-Enter) will
#      not behave usefully in a multi-monitor environment.
#
#      Note that this definition is always enabled in the Cygwin
#      build, since at the time of writing this <multimon.h> is
#      known not to be available in Cygwin.
#
#  - COMPAT=/DMSVC4
#  - RCFL=/DMSVC4
#      Makes a couple of minor changes so that PuTTY compiles using
#      MSVC 4. You will also need /DNO_SECURITY and /DNO_MULTIMON.
#
#  - RCFL=/DASCIICTLS
#      Uses ASCII rather than Unicode to specify the tab control in
#      the resource file. Probably most useful when compiling with
#      Cygnus/mingw32, whose resource compiler may have less of a
#      problem with it.
#
#  - XFLAGS=/DTELNET_DEFAULT
#      Causes PuTTY to default to the Telnet protocol (in the absence
#      of Default Settings and so on to the contrary). Normally PuTTY
#      will default to SSH.
#
#  - XFLAGS=/DDEBUG
#      Causes PuTTY to enable internal debugging.
#
#  - XFLAGS=/DMALLOC_LOG
#      Causes PuTTY to emit a file called putty_mem.log, logging every
#      memory allocation and free, so you can track memory leaks.
#
#  - XFLAGS=/DMINEFIELD
#      Causes PuTTY to use a custom memory allocator, similar in
#      concept to Electric Fence, in place of regular malloc(). Wastes
#      huge amounts of RAM, but should cause heap-corruption bugs to
#      show up as GPFs at the point of failure rather than appearing
#      later on as second-level damage.
