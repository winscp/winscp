This is the README for the source archive of PuTTY, a free Win32
Telnet and SSH client.

If you want to rebuild PuTTY from source, we provide a variety of
Makefiles and equivalents. (If you have fetched the source from CVS,
you'll have to generate the Makefiles yourself -- see below.)

For building on Windows:

 - Makefile.vc is for command-line builds on MS Visual C++ systems.
   Type `nmake -f Makefile.vc' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

   (We've also had one report of success building with the
   OpenWatcom compiler -- www.openwatcom.org -- using Makefile.vc
   with `wmake -ms -f makefile.vc' and NO_MULTIMON, although we
   haven't tried this ourselves.)

 - Inside the MSVC subdirectory are MS Visual Studio project files
   for doing GUI-based builds of the various PuTTY utilities. These
   have been tested on Visual Studio 6.

   You should be able to build each PuTTY utility by loading the
   corresponding .dsp file in Visual Studio. For example,
   MSVC/putty/putty.dsp builds PuTTY itself, MSVC/plink/plink.dsp
   builds Plink, and so on.

 - Makefile.bor is for the Borland C compiler. Type `make -f
   Makefile.bor' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

 - Makefile.cyg is for Cygwin / mingw32 installations. Type `make -f
   Makefile.cyg' to build all the PuTTY binaries. Note that by
   default the Pageant WinNT security features and the multiple
   monitor support are excluded from the Cygwin build, since at the
   time of writing this Cygwin doesn't include the necessary
   headers.

 - Makefile.lcc is for lcc-win32. Type `make -f Makefile.lcc'. (You
   will probably need to specify COMPAT=-DNO_MULTIMON.)

For building on Unix:

 - unix/Makefile.gtk is for Unix and GTK. If you don't have GTK, you
   should still be able to build the command-line utilities (PSCP,
   PSFTP, Plink, PuTTYgen) using this makefile. The makefile expects
   you to change into the `unix' subdirectory, then run `make -f
   Makefile.gtk'. Note that Unix PuTTY has mostly only been tested
   on Linux so far; portability problems such as BSD-style ptys or
   different header file requirements are expected.

   There is an `install' target; note that by default it tries to
   install `man' pages, which need to be built using Halibut first --
   see below.

All of the Makefiles are generated automatically from the file
`Recipe' by the Perl script `mkfiles.pl'. Additions and corrections
to Recipe and the mkfiles.pl are much more useful than additions and
corrections to the alternative Makefiles themselves.

Documentation (in various formats including Windows Help and Unix
`man' pages) is to be built from the Halibut (`.but') files in the
`doc' subdirectory using `doc/Makefile'. Halibut can be found at
<http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/halibut/>.

If you want to send bug reports or feature requests, please read the
Feedback section of the web site before doing so. Sending one-line
reports saying `it doesn't work' will waste your time as much as
ours.
