This is the README for the source archive of PuTTY, a free Win32
Telnet and SSH client.

If you want to rebuild PuTTY from source, we provide three
Makefiles:

 - Makefile.vc is for MS Visual C++ systems. Type `nmake -f
   Makefile.vc' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

   (We've also had one report of success building with the
   OpenWatcom compiler -- www.openwatcom.org -- using Makefile.vc
   with `wmake -ms -f makefile.vc' and NO_MULTIMON, although we
   haven't tried this ourselves.)

 - Makefile.bor is for the Borland C compiler. Type `make -f
   Makefile.bor' to build all the PuTTY binaries.

 - Makefile.cyg is for Cygwin / mingw32 installations. Type `make -f
   Makefile.cyg' to build all the PuTTY binaries. Note that by
   default the Pageant WinNT security features and the multiple
   monitor support are excluded from the Cygwin build, since at the
   time of writing this Cygwin doesn't include the necessary
   headers.

If you have MS Visual Studio version 6 and you want to build a
DevStudio project for GUI editing and debugging, you should be aware
that the default GUI configuration of the compiler falls over on the
nasty macros in ssh.c. This is a bug in Visual Studio. The culprit
is the /ZI compiler option (debug info generation: Edit and
Continue). To avoid this problem while compiling PuTTY under VS6,
you should:
 - right-click ssh.c in the FileView
 - click Settings
 - select the C/C++ tab and the General category
 - under `Debug info:', select anything _other_ than `Program
   Database for Edit and Continue'.
Alternatively disable the /ZI option, replacing it with a saner
value, such as /Zi.

All of the Makefiles are generated automatically from the file
`Recipe' by the Perl script `mkfiles.pl'. Additions and corrections
to Recipe and the mkfiles.pl are much more useful than additions and
corrections to the alternative Makefiles themselves.

If you want to send bug reports or feature requests, please read the
Feedback section of the web site before doing so. Sending one-line
reports saying `it doesn't work' will waste your time as much as
ours.
