    <summary>The WinSCP .NET assembly is a .NET wrapper around WinSCP’s scripting interface.</summary>
    <description>The WinSCP .NET assembly is a .NET wrapper around WinSCP’s scripting interface that allows your code to connect to a remote machine and manipulate remote files over SFTP, FTP, WebDAV, S3 and SCP sessions.

The library is primarily intended for advanced automation tasks that require conditional processing, loops or other control structures for which a basic WinSCP scripting interface is too limited. The library is not a general purpose file transfer library. It particularly have a limited support for interactive processing and as such it is not well suited for use in GUI applications.

For documentation and examples of use, see project website.

The NuGet package includes the assembly itself and a required WinSCP executable. When installed, it adds the assembly as reference to your project and sets up WinSCP executable to be copied to project output directory, so that it can be found on run-time.</description>
